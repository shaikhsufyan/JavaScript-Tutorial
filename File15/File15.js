// : Array in Javascript ::

// Defination :
/* Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
 This is compared to a variable that can store only one value. 
 Each item in an array has a number attached to it, called a 
 numeric index, that allows you to access it. In JavaScript, 
 arrays start at index zero and can be manipulated with various 
 methods.
*/

// Array is collection items
// index start from 0 number
// array represented by []

let friends = ["Aman", "Karan", "Haris", "Arsh"];
// console.log(friends.length);
// friends[3]="John";
   let string = friends.toString();
   console.log(string);

 





// Access value
// change value
// find length
// change element from an array

// toString
